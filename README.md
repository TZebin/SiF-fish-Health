### Summary Plots Using SHAP Library: Biomarker expression in All samples
![Summary Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31511385/115146931-a3bf8e80-a050-11eb-83bb-859ecc2ef547.png)

### Global Feature Importance Plots

Biomarkers: Top 4 from the summary plots for healthy fishes (ALDO, LACTA, CO2, NA/K)

Top 4 from Summary plots of unhealthy fishes (CK, CK MB, LDH, ALT).

A combined waterfall plot with global feature importance plot can show further on how many samples we may have under each decision node in our random forest models.

In the diagram shown above, with CK MB values alone, the model is capable of organizing/ separate more than 30% of its total observations to healthy and unhealthy. With further information on LDH increases the coverage/cumulative ratio to >50% and so on. 

###  Depndence Plots: Biomarker Range Identification
From the dependence plots, it is possible to identify biomarker ranges that are impacting the model positively or negatively based on the data the model has seen during training, for example, a CK MB value below 7K is showing some negative impact on the model as models positive case is Unhealthy by configuration. So some observations/samples are having more impact on the model than the others.

Example Insight:
Based on the SHAP dependence plots, fishes, that were Healthy tend to have the following features:
CK MB < 10K;
LDH <1000;
NA/K > 150.
On the other hand, opposite may apply for most unhealthy cases:
CK MB > 10K;
have LDH >1000;
NA/K < 150.
From the waterfall plot these three conditions can separate out 60% of the observations in our dataset.

### Further Exploratory Analysis : Dashboads and bubble plots

### Unsupervised Explorlation: K-means and t-SNE for hybrid semi-supervised model development

![Cluster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31511385/115149080-58aa7900-a05a-11eb-9807-e3581bd3a8e3.PNG)
With 3 clusters, we can assign cluster 2 and 3 as healthy with some unhealthyâ€™s in them aand cluster 1 as unhealthy, which would lead to better accuracy in terms of cluster to supervised label alignment.
